PREDICTING STEEL PLANT SALES

OVERVIEW:

Developed a comprehensive web application for forecasting steel plant sales using Flask and Python. The system employs advanced machine learning 
techniques and utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn to analyze historical sales data and generate accurate future 
sales predictions. The application features an intuitive web interface where users can enter specific dates to receive tailored sales forecasts. 
This tool aids in strategic decision-making for inventory management and production planning by providing actionable insights based on predictive analytics.

FEATURES:

-Analyzes historical sales data using machine learning techniques with Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

-Provides accurate sales forecasts for future dates.

-Accessible via a web interface built with Flask, allowing users to input dates and view predictions.

-Assists in strategic planning for inventory and production based on predictive insights.

REQUIRMENTS:

Flask: For building the web application framework.
